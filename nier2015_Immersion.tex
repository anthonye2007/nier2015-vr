\begin{abstract}
Software engineers primarily interact with software using a keyboard and mouse and typically view software on three or fewer monitors.
This interaction paradigm does not take advantage of many affordances of natural human movement.
Virtual reality environments designed for software engineering could greatly increase productivity by taking advantage of natural human affordances.
This paper describes the benefits of virtual reality environments in software engineering, discusses open research questions, and examines challenges that need to be overcome.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
%[Affordances of VR]
Virtual reality (VR) could increase the productivity of software engineers by several orders of magnitude because it offers affordances not yet used in software engineering.
Head-mounted VR displays allow the user to update their view by moving or rotating their neck, even a full 360 degrees.
Additionally, these displays render a slightly different image for each eye (stereoscopic rendering) which enables the human eye to more easily sense depth of images on the display.
These two affordances from VR head-mounted displays enable the user to feel immersed in a virtual environment.
We envision a future where software engineers work in immersive environments which take advantage of more affordances of the human body than current workstations.

%[Applications of VR in software engineering]
% This section could be said in better words or bullet points, or VR, or *something*
We describe our vision of what software engineering would look like with VR by illustrating various principles across four different immersive VR environments.
First, we show how an immersive code review environment could enable software engineers to more easily analyze and navigate information which leads to increased understanding of the software.
Secondly, we show how an immersive live coding environment could enable much faster development times when creating 3D scenes.
Next we show how a social immersive environment could improve communication among remote development teams.
Finally, we show how an immersive environment could be used to experience physical analogs of abstract software.

%[Discussion]
We provide a brief discussion of some open research questions and discuss some of the challenges of using VR in software engineering with existing technologies.

\section{Affordances of Virtual Reality}
% this is what VR can give that has not been captured by other domains
% go into a bit of detail for each item
% give concrete example of VR: we used the Rift and Leap Motion
% the affordances allow an immersive environment: big whoop. Why should I care about an immersive environment?

The text in this section is practically worthless. Will be updated later.

Head-mounted VR displays allow the user to update their view by moving or rotating their neck, even a full 360 degrees.
Additionally, these displays render a slightly different image for each eye (stereoscopic rendering) which enables the human eye to more easily sense depth of images on the display.
These two affordances from VR head-mounted displays enable the user to feel immersed in a virtual environment.

VR devices render a slightly different image for each eye (stereoscopic rendering) which allows humans to sense depth in the images just like in the physical world. 
VR devices also completely immerse the user in the environment, so that the user's head has six degrees of freedom. 
This realistic imitation of the human body enables easier and more natural navigation as well as the ability to display more information at once in a meaningful way. 
We get the naturalness of the physical world and the malleabillity of the virtual world.

We argue that these affordances provide a platform for new kinds of software engineering tools. 
We imagine a future in which many software engineers find it most productive to design and build software within a VR environment. 

To immerse the user in a virtual environment we used a head-mounted display (Oculus Rift - Development Kit 2) and a Leap Motion Controller for gesture recognition.

There have been substantial amounts of VR research done in the past, but very little of it has shown how VR can aid in software engineering. 
In this paper we present a vision of four software engineering activities that could benefit from VR.

\end{figure*}

\section{Applications}
% ties all application together
% take advantage of the affordances of VR
  % immersive env => lots of info at once
  % stereoscopic => true 3D; depth
Virtual environments can use the immersive property to display more information than on a computer monitor. 
We are still limited by the field of view of the human eye, so putting more information on the display is not novel, but what is novel is being able to distribute that information around the user in a meaningful way. 
This immersion is possible because the Rift uses stereoscopic rendering (creates a slightly different image for each eye) to enable depth sensing.

In this section we describe how VR could aid in code review, live coding, remote collaboration, and simulation. 
Our main contribution is not these specific ideas, but to show the possibilities of software engineering with VR.

\subsection{Code Review}
%First, we show how an immersive code review environment could enable software engineers to more easily analyze and navigate information which leads to increased understanding of the software.

The primary reason for modern code reviews not resulting in more defects found is a lack of understanding of the code being modified~\cite{bacchelli:ModernCodeReviewChallenges}. 
We created a prototype VR tool called Immersion that uses the overview and detail paradigm [cite] in three ways to allow reviewers to more easily find, analyze and navigate information relevant to the code being modified in this review.
The user views the environment through an Oculus Rift and interacts with hand gestures recognized by a Leap Motion Controller.

% piles vs circle
\subsubsection{Piles as an Overview}
Immersion shows code fragments similar to Code Bubbles~\cite{Bragdon:CodeBubbles}, but each fragment consists of exactly one method.  
The reviewer initially sees the active fragment in the center of the screen with other relevant information distributed around the floor in piles with more relevant piles closer to the reviewer. 
The reviewer is able to scan the label of the pile and number of fragments in each pile to quickly verify if this pile is indeed relevant. 
The reviewer then makes a grabbing motion towards the most interesting pile and pulls their hand up to show all of the fragments in a circular expanded view to the right of the active fragment.

% circle: foremost vs other fragments
\subsubsection{Expanded Circle}
The reviewer is now able to read the foremost fragment in the circle and can make horizontal finger swipes to rotate the circle and read other fragments. 
Immersion uses semantic zoom to make method names readable even when at the back of the circle and the fragment retains its height so that the reviewer can quickly see how many lines of code it has. 
The reviewer can select an especially large method using a pinch motion on the top and bottom and move it to become the active fragment. 
The piles then change to include code relevant to the new fragment. 
The reviewer can move their hand as if clearing off a desk to return to the previous active fragment.

% git diff + complexity vs active fragment
\subsubsection{Big Picture}
Immersion also displays overview diagrams of this changeset to allow the reviewer to see where this active fragment fits into the changeset as a whole. 
Similarly an overview of the cyclomatic complexity also helps the reviewer to see which areas of the code would be most relevant to see. 
These diagrams illustrate how VR is able to show multiple overview and detail diagrams without overwhelming the user.

Immersive VR environments have a lot more space for information display than current computer workstations.
We used Immersion to illustrate that VR software engineering tools can use this increased space and the affordances of VR to more easily analyze and navigate the displayed information.
% What does VR provide that makes this different from using a Leap with 5 monitors?

\subsection{Live Coding}
RiftSketch is a live coding environment built for VR. 
It allows a user to describe a 3D scene using geometries, materials, textures, lights, meshes and other primitives provided by the Three.js library, which is a convenient wrapper for the WebGL APIs available in modern browsers. 
RiftSketch presents a user with a simple text editor, floating in front of them in an otherwise empty VR world. 
As the user types code into the editor, the world around them updates instantly to display the 3D scene dictated by their code. 
RiftSketch also allows the user to animate their scene via a callback function which is executed on every frame. 
The user can manipulate the state of the 3D scene in this looped block of code in order to add behaviour to the objects in their scene.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=80mm]{figures/riftsketch/closer}
\caption{RiftSketch screenshot \label{riftsketch}}
\end{figure}

Furthermore, RiftSketch provides the user with shortcuts and input methods to quickly edit numbers in the code that they write. 
Keyboard shortcuts allow the user to increment or decrement numbers in the code by increments of 0.1, 10 or 100. 
Integration with the Leap Motion Controller provides users with the ability to manipulate numbers using natural input: the user places the editor's cursor over a number and then can move their hand up and down above the Leap Motion controller in order to increase or decrease the number. 
Numbers in the code could represent anything, from the X, Y or Z components of a position or rotation vector, the red, green or blue components of an object's material or a component in the calculation of an object's animated speed.

Although the current implementation of RiftSketch is little more than a creative toy, the experience of using it shows the potential of practical applications. 
Largely inspired by Bret Victor's seminal lecture, "Inventing on Principle"~\cite{Victor:InventingOnPrincipleVideo}\cite{Victor:InventingOnPrincipleTranscript}, RiftSketch demonstrates the potency of giving a creator, or programmer, a direct and immediate connection to their creation. 
This tight feedback loop allows the programmer to better understand the effect of every part of the code that they write and to quickly experiment with various solutions, algorithms and calculations. 
RiftSketch is also very effective as a learning tool since users can see their mistakes immediately and correct themselves without an intermediate compile step that might otherwise act as a hinderance.  
These benefits are especially evident in RiftSketch when the code describes a VR scene. 
Watching the entire virtual world change around you as you type can be an extremely powerful and engaging experience.

In practical applications, one could extend the concept of live coding and tight feedback loops in order to create customized programming environments. 
VR programming environments could allow the user to take advantage of the malleability and expanse of virtual worlds. 
For example, a user could live code a widget that indicates some statistic of the code they are currently editing, such as the cyclomatic complexity, test coverage or test result. 
The widget would update itself as the user typed, not unlike existing code feedback tools such as NCrunch \footnote{NCrunch automated concurrent testing tool: http://www.ncrunch.net/}, and they could position the widget in their virtual periphery.

\subsection{Remote Collaboration}
% Imagining room inside HiFi with multiple avatars
% each developer could have an avatar
% able to get facial expressions
% able to get body language (although somewhat expensive right now, these prices will come down)

% able to sense body language in real time
% able to hear in real time
% environment is dynamic

% pair programming
Co-located development teams are able to communicate in person. 
Distributed teams can try, but the technology is too slow and it doesn't feel good. 
High Fidelity \footnote{https://highfidelity.io/} is implementing infrastructure for virtual worlds that is fast enough for developers to be able to sense body language and hear audio in real time.  
Distributed development teams will have the foundational issues of remote communication solved which enables a shared VR environment to become truly powerful.

A benefit of co-location is pair programming, where two developers program at the same computer and can catch each others errors. 
VR and body sensing with a device like PrioVR would enable remote developers to be at a shared virtual desk right next to each other. 
They would be able to see the same files, talk in real time, and even point to which line of the code they are talking about. 

% pair 'live coding'/code review
Sharing a live coding environment enables all participants to have a tight feedback loop. 
This could be especially useful when the primary developer of a section needs to explain their modifications to the rest of the team. 
Everyone could meet in the shared VR live coding environment and watch while the developer walks through modification of their code. 
The team would be able to see how the system changed rather than looking through large amounts of code.

  % pair designing
Co-located teams can design together around a whiteboard in a conference room as they talk through the problems of the system. 
A shared VR environment could have a similar room with sketching space that everyone can see. 
Developers could drag-and-drop files or code snippets to display on the walls around them. 
They could then discuss and annotate the code. 
Additionally, visualizations such as structure diagrams or architecture of related systems could be overlaid on a wall for reference.

% exploring data visualization together
Remote workers could experience immersive visualizations together. 
A control flow graph could be represented by a maze of rooms through which the team could walk. 
The team members could trace different paths and yet still be shown an overlay of where each of the other members are and how these positions relate to each other. 
Currently remote workers can each trace separate paths of the code but have a hard time communicating what those paths are and how they relate to each other.

Remote workers often miss out on many benefits that in-person communication can bring. 
Shared VR spaces tailored to developers' activities can fill some of the gaps caused by distance and help the team to function better together. 

\subsection{Simulation}
Virtual Reality is well-suited to applications with physical analogs that can be simulated in 3D. 
Although simulation software is not uncommon, 3D worlds are often difficult to to navigate and interact with when displayed on 2D devices. 
Users have to actively think about moving a camera viewpoint in 3D space in order to view a certain part of a simulation. 
Interacting with a simulation might require positioning a virtual cursor. 

VR, on the other hand, allows users to view, explore and manipulate simulated worlds directly by physically turning their head to look around a simulated car plant or by using their hands, via a Leap Motion controller, to interact with a simulated robot. 
These direct interactions provide a subtle but important advantage over 2D-projected simulations. 
This sense of immersion gives the users unimpeded access to the simulation which would allow for quicker turn-around when testing or debugging the simulated software, especially if combined with a live-coding solution.

For example, imagine you're a member of a space mission that has just landed a probe on the surface of a comet.
After 10 years in flight, the probe has arrived at its destination against all odds but has landed at an odd angle and without deploying its anchoring harpoons. 
You are tasked with updating the lander's software to reposition itself safely on solid ground and you have 24 hours before its batteries die. 

Thankfully the companion orbiter has gathered detailed information about the surface around the landing site and telemetry data tells you exactly where and how the lander is positioned. 
You update your simulation with the data and step into VR to survey the situation. 
After assessing the lander's options, you live-code and iterate on a number of solutions. 
With each one you observe the lander's behaviour inside the simulation. 
You walk around the lander to inspect it's position after each maneuver, leaning in to ensure that its feet are planted firmly in the regolith, zooming out to an orbital view to verify that its new position maintains a line-of-sight to the orbiter on this lob-sided comet. 
Finally, after having run the simulation dozens of times and being confident in your solution, you upload the program with time to spare. 
The lander repositions itself as expected and the historic mission can continue successfully.

\section{Discussion}
% VR vs AR in the future, which is better?
  % code snippets while wearing Google Glass could appear on peripherals
We have presented virtual environments that completely immerse the user. 
Other devices such as Google Glass, aim to help the user complete tasks in the physical world by adding information overlays (augmented reality). 
Augmented reality seeks to help the user in the physical world while virtual reality seeks to completely replace physical reality. 
Is it more useful to immerse the user in a completely virtual, dynamic environment, or to enhance the physical world of developers?
  
% Manipulating environment
% Utilize the 'experience'?
  % Gamification of code review
Virtual reality is able to make users feel `presence', that is, to trick their mind into thinking they are physically in the environment. 
This is critical to entertainment experiences but would creating such a compelling experience have tangible benefits like improved defect detection rate in a code review environment? 

% Where is the limit for too much info displayed at once?
The main advantage of VR is being able to display more information at once to the user.  
At what point does the extra information cause overload and begin to hinder productivity?  
Is this balance between amount of information and processing speed the same for each person (other aspects of VR can differ per person)?

% Does using a VR code review tool actually increase comprehension? Does it allow users to find bugs and provide alternative solutions?

% What gestures are most natural in VR?
What is the best way for the user to provide input to a VR system? 
The games industry has found a console controller to work well for navigation and limited action support but those controllers are poorly suited for text entry. 
However, while the keyboard is well suited for text entry, many people find it hard to type while wearing a head-mounted display. 
Gesture recognition devices like the Leap Motion Controller and Kinect sensor enable the user to perform more natural gestures, but often put too much strain on the user's arms. 
Voice recognition added to gesture recognition could help to reduce that arm strain, but speaking to one's computer may feel disruptive and awkward in a shared office space.

How can software engineers take advantage of the affordances of VR to improve upon existing 3D visualizations?

% What use the z-axis for?
% Use VR for specific activities?
% Will a developer buy a Rift just for the tools?
What barriers of adoption will be present for software engineers and what steps can researchers take now to mitigate those barriers?

\section{Challenges}
% Here is a chance to include some honest things that need to be overcome, for example, resolution, nausea, configuration, pupil distance, etc.
VR technology has come a long ways but there are still challenges that need to be overcome for widespread adoption by software engineers.
% Nausea
\subsection{Nausea}
The main challenge to be overcome is nausea, or simulator sickness.
Users can become nauseous when they attempt to interact with the system but the system does not respond quickly enough.
This is most apparent with head rotation, where users rotate their physical heads expecting to see an updated view but still see the initial view.
This issue can largely be solved by using higher quality gaming graphics cards.

\subsection{Resolution}
The Development Kit 2 of the Oculus Rift has a resolution of 1080p (ensure they say this on the website) but this allows merely passable reading of text. 
Future iterations of the Rift and other head-mounted displays will need increased resolution to provide a more comfortable experience.
Increased resolution will increase the sense of presence which in turn should reduce nausea.

\subsection{Ease of Configuration}
Small changes in configuration can provide large changes in results.
This means that the Rift must be configured for each user which can take up to 15 minutes.

\subsubsection{Inter-pupillary distance}
One way to decrease nausea is to measure the distance between the user's pupils to more accurately render an image for each eye.
A software utility produced by Oculus attempts to measure this distance but is hard to use and often has varying results if used incorrectly.
Users would have a better experience if there was an easier way to measure the inter-pupillary distance.

\subsubsection{Lenses and Field of View}
The Rift puts a display very close to users' eyes and uses lenses to provide proper distortion.
Users can adjust the distance from their eyes to the lenses in order to obtain a sharper image and reduce nausea.
Users who typically wear eyeglasses can sometimes fit the headset overtop of their eyeglasses, but then must push the lenses as far away as possible, which decreases the field of view.
Alternatively, users can remove their eyeglasses and use stronger lenses instead to allow the lenses to be closer to the eyes.
However, these alternative lenses still reduce the field of view slightly, are not as powerful as required for some users, and removing one's eyeglasses becomes annoying if done frequently.

Increased resolution and easier configuration will help reduce nausea in users, and these improvements are necessary for widespread adoption by software engineers.

\section{Related Work}
Virtual environments called CAVEs have been around since the 1990's in which a person can be in a physical room with displays covering all surfaces~\cite{Cruz-Neira:CAVE}.  
Users often use head-mounted displays with head tracking to update the displays and may use hand-held devices to enable interaction with objects in the CAVE.

Andrew Bragdon has implemented a system called Code Bubbles that enables the user to pull out methods from a file. 
The user is then able to move and group the methods as desired.  
Code Bubbles also can display the call graph for the selected method and allows the user to open called methods~\cite{Bragdon:CodeBubbles}.

Code Canvas added semantic zoom to the Code Bubbles tool, allowing the user to gain a better understanding of how the current section of the system fits into the system as a whole~\cite{DeLine:CodeCanvas}.

Chris Parnin developed a tool called NosePrints which allows users to quickly see if a code smell is relevant~\cite{parnin:Noseprints}.

Agarwala used piles to add structure to a 3D desktop.~\cite{Agarawala:BumpTop}

Yongpisanpop created Bugarium that integrated a Leap Motion Controller to aid both interaction and visualization in a large-scale bug repository~\cite{Bugarium}.

RoomAlive by Microsoft Research is similar to a CAVE but uses six Kinect sensors around the room to track the user.  This eliminates the need for wearable devices by the user but requires significant amounts of space.~\cite{Jones:RoomAlive}

\section{Conclusions}
We have shown that virtual reality enables a new interaction paradigm that can improve developers' lives. 
The immersive environment allows users to process more information at once and stereoscopic rendering enables depth-sensing. 
Together, these affordances provide a novel platform for new software engineering tools.
